  <h1>Manufactured Home Warranty</h1>
  <p> </p>
  <p>All of our Atchafalaya Homes are built to or excede HUD Code manufactured home construction requirements to ensure that your manufactured home is quality built. Your single-wide, double-wide or triple-wide manufactured home, will all be built using the HUD Code requirements to form our standard manufacturer’s warranty to ensure the durability of your home.  Be sure to review the terms of your warranty for coverage exclusions when you purchase your new home.</p>
  <h3><span>All of our homes come with the following Manufactured Home Warranty</span></h3>
  <p> </p>
  <p>One-year standard manufacturer’s warranty will cover any defects that can cause structural or safety issues that occur within the first year of ownership and are due to flaws that occurred during the home building process. The manufacturer warrants that your new home has been constructed to meet or exceed all applicable governmental requirements and that the home’s structure, plumbing, heating and electrical systems, and all appliances and equipment installed by the manufacturer, is free under normal use from manufacturing defects in material or workmanship. The warranty typically begins on the date of the original retail delivery (or the date of first occupancy, if used as a commercial unit) and extends for a period of one year from such date. The warranty covers only those defects which become evident within the first year, which is the applicable warranty period, and when written notice is provided by the buyer to the retailer or manufacturer no later than 15 days after the expiration of such warranty period.</p>
  <p>Because we want our customers to be fully satisfied, we also will cover cosmetic damages that you may find in your home in addition to the standard warranty. All you have to do is make sure you report them within the first 30 days after your move-in date. Cosmetic damages that we cover include small scuffs and nicks on the interior or exterior and trim damage that was are the result of a manufacturing flaw.</p>
  <p>Extended Warranties can be purchased at the time you purchase your home. </p>
